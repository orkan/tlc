Response time increasing

FlareSolverr 3.3.21
Chrome / Chromium major version: 123

PROBLEM:
Response times increasing from 2 sec on 1st request to 30 sec after 20 requests.

SOLUTION 1:
Disable cfg[proxy_sessions] = false, which gives acceptable 5s response times.

SOLUTION 2:
Enable cfg[proxy_sessions] = true, together with cfg[proxy_session_ttl] = 60
Gives 1-2s response times!
